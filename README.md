# Classic Terminal Revisited
This is my public repository for my VS Code color theme. It'll mostly remain as-is unless Microsoft adds new color keys or new VS Code releases require changes for some reason.

## Updates
If something needs to be updated, please create an issue or a pull request! Feedback is always welcome!
